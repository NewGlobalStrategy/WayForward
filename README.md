# WayForward
Some markdown on alternatives routes forward for humanity - the current arrangements have issues.
This repository will host markdown files analyzing where we are and what we hope to achieve by developing
version 2 of an asynchronous decision making platform. The closest current thinking to what will be outlined here that we have seen to date is in the writings of Charles Hugh Smith and to an extent the Zeitgeist Movement.  
However ideas like CLIME still seem to be too big a leap from where we are for critical mass to be obtained and most blockchain based solutions also have a significant level of complexity that is basically inherent.  A simple platform to support asynchronous decisions seems a more logical next step.  I will also apprach this topic from an underlying philosophy of hard determinism as this seems generally helpful as an approach to reducing the massive blame game that living currently appears to be.
