# What is the problem?
I have provided some background on the issues and problems you need to solve to get a reasonable strategy for the world.  We have covered a good deal of ground, however we have not yet focussed much on exactly what the problems are. 

Before starting let me re-iterate that there are massive problems here and they are getting relatively little focus, perhaps in part as you lack the vision to see what could be achieved with better alignment and cooperation. Everyone on your planet has a problem if they enjoy living as this will be a fairly transitory state unless they focus more on how to extend lifespans.  It seems now that dying of Covid-19 is a major global issue which justifies all sorts of questionable rules and regulations.  However dying of other things remains "just the way it is" and efforts to change this remain rather limited.

There is a strange perception among some people on your planet that they are winning and certainly the distribution of wealth is rather unequal and by this measure, there are a few clear winners while the vast majority are losers.  However, the winners are playing last century’s game and they have successfully demotivated and pissed off the majority with a toxic mix of entitlement and condescension.  This is a huge hindrance to progress on this century’s agenda of fixing poverty, disease and curing aging.

The rules are set by the global elite, but they can only do this with the consent of the majority.  That majority needs to move the consensus along a bit and perhaps redefine winning as living for a thousand years.  One of your leading bio-gerontologists has suggested that the first thousand-year-old person is already alive and among you – however, even comments like this generate very limited traction and focus.  

There is a fear and reluctance to move forward based on a strange perception that the planet is approaching capacity.  We expect that with improved behavior the capacity of this planet is much closer to eighty billion people than 8 billion – reaching that capacity will require that many of you stop running around like blue-arsed flies and overindulging.

We have visited other planets and I can confirm to you that this planet is seriously under-achieving on numerous criteria.  Some specific measures where your performance would be considered poor to abysmal by universal standards would be:

1	% of people not getting their needs met
2	% of people not receiving basic healthcare
3	Accidental death rate
4	Level of violent crime
5	Rate of depletion of non-renewable resources
6	%age  of  people  over-consuming
7	Number of refugees

The problem may lie in one or more of the following areas which we will look at:
1	Irrationality
2	Relativity
3	Hierarchy & motivations of leaders and their followers
4	Market Failure
5	Lack of vision and inspiration
6	Inability to organize optimally at global, local and all levels in between
7	The general acceptance of poor standards of behavior
8	Apathy
9	Poor and selfish decision-making
10 Communication problems

### Irrationality

Human beings, in general, are innately irrational (13) and while this has been documented it is not widely accepted.  Problems not accepted are not readily dealt with.  Careful analysis rather than instinctive judgment has been identified as one technique to reduce irrational decisions.  A significant proportion of people on the planet still have faith and indeed the vast majority of your political leaders claim to be religious.  We find this somewhat surprising.  While we can rationalize that some of them are just doing this to appear more acceptable and to help their election bids there do appear to be some that are genuinely deluded enough to think that their actions are likely to be judged favorably and provide them with a hero’s reception in the afterlife.

We have reviewed the actions and achievements of the typical political leader and many of the recent ones appear to have started foreign wars, authorized murders, increased the numbers of people living in poverty and protected the wealthy and the bankers from inevitable losses that arise at the end of a borrowing binge.  These actions are completely at odds with religious teachings and consequently, they must be delusional if they think they are.

Many leaders have also promised many things they are incapable of delivering without over-spending and out-competing other leaders.  Economists stay employed by telling their employers what they want to hear and so short term Keynesian deficit spending has become a near-permanent distortion.  The laws of mathematics will bring this to an end in the not too distant future.

In practice, your politicians don’t have as much power as they claim to have.  Arguably most people who want to be in power are also unsuitable to be leaders – hence the need to change the approach.  It is a major problem that there are so many people pretending to be in charge of running your world but in reality, there is nobody in charge and this is a highly inefficient arrangement.

You have this dysfunctional partnership between politics and economics that massively underachieves for the majority of people.  We would propose some new ideas for both legs of the partnership.

A great deal of economics is based on the premise of rational economic maximizing man.   This made some sense at the time of Adam Smith and probably continued to have a degree of relevance throughout the last millennium.  Arguably however it has now morphed into an oxymoron.  Given the advances you are making in medical science and the further potential for progress, it seems to us that anybody who sets out to die wealthy lacks ambition.

As for politicians, it has been said that people treat them like diapers and so they are changed frequently and for similar reasons.  Technology now appears to allow civilization to mature. You will still look for politicians to campaign, entertain and promote solutions to the issues of the day but you will no longer depend on them for decision making.  This is beneficial as they have frequently proved to be an expensive, unreliable and disappointing solution to problems.

### Relativity

We bring up relativity not in the Einsteinien sense but in the real problem that humans have in needing to compare themselves to everyone else.  This is a serious issue as there is a great deal of comparing going on and doing better than others appears to be a real objective and source of both happiness and misery for many.

Indeed we suspect that some of you would be happy living in a shit shower for 23 hours a day provided others had to endure living there for the full 24 hours.  If you were also a stakeholder, perhaps with a financial or managerial interest in the showering enterprise, then you would be even happier and you would also be focussed on maintaining the status quo as progress might diminish your influence and income.  The “I’m alright Jack” mentality is to an extent understandable as none of you have any chance of fixing the world on your own and therefore it is individually reasonable to try and get the best out of it that you can.

### Hierarchy

The establishment of a hierarchy within all human endeavors is a problem.  Your typical working arrangements de-motivate the majority for most of the time.  This is important because so many people are not engaged in their working activities. The few that are leading and focussed are typically either operating in capitalist ventures or carrying out fairly short term focussed Government activities.  

You have to some extent tried both socialism and capitalism and while neither of these systems has been implemented in any sort of pure form without considerable ‘cronyism’ you have identified that both systems have significant challenges.  The way forward definitely requires improved linking of performance and benefits for all individuals with agreed performance standards being established for different tasks.

### Market Failure

Neither hierarchy nor irrationality appears sufficient to explain the lack of focus on this planet.  Perhaps it is a genuine case of market failure for long-term and uncertain projects that is the problem.  Controlling, managing and ideally stopping the aging process for all will be a very difficult task and it will probably take a long time to complete.  However, a great deal of change and progress can happen in 50 years.  If you had asked people in 1919 if they thought it was possible for man to travel to the moon 50 years later there would have been few that expected this to happen.  As we have also highlighted the global population is much greater now so the potential talent pool to work on projects has never been greater.  

Currently, a great deal of this talent appears to be focussed on really rather stupid financial games in which it will probably never be entirely clear whether the cleverest or the luckiest will record the financial gains.  The failure rate of human life has always been 100% and it seems reasonable to think that the more effort is focussed on reducing this rate the quicker it will start to fall.  

There is currently no obvious way to make an investment in gerontology research and have any real expectation that you will get the return on investment that you are looking for.  As your species is presently so financially focussed you end up with significant levels of unemployment combined with serious problems with healthcare and aging that are not being addressed.  So there is a problem here that your present markets and organizations are not capable of dealing with.

### Lack of Vision and inspiration

The current generation of political leaders is unlikely to have the satisfaction of delivering this achievement – however, it will be a much more useful achievement than getting a few men to step on the moon.  The majority of these in power presumably believe that it’s not achievable within their lifetime and are therefore not interested in dedicating resources to it.  This seems illogical.  There are so many surprising things that waste significant resources on this planet and yet there is no focussed initiative to solve what appears to be the biggest human problem of all.

In general, the survival instinct of individuals seems to be strong and we think this will triumph over any philosophical objections that people living longer will require fewer people to be born in the future.  We have faced this issue on other planets and the thinking has always been that progress of the planet would happen quicker with a stable productive population having more time to focus on the solving problems and that this, in turn, would allow colonization of other planets quicker.  Consequently, more of our species would get a chance of life in the fullness of time.  Any individual can end their life or more likely elect to have a period of hibernation once you establish the processes for doing this if their conscience dictates.

### Inability to organize

As a planet, you are severely challenged to organize effectively on a large scale.  This seems largely because you lack efficient and effective methods of group decision making.  You appear to have two principal means of group decision making at present.  These are:
1	Meetings
2	Elections/Surveys

While small group meetings can be quite productive meetings have a serious limit to scalability.  Beyond around twenty people their effectiveness rapidly diminishes.  So as a means of achieving global consensus meetings are severely challenged.

For large scale consultations, your planet has generally resorted to elections and referendum and these are frequently held out as triumphs of human achievement.  I do appreciate that universal suffrage was a right not easily attained and still not available in many parts of your world.  The fact remains that democracy is a fairly terrible means of making decisions.  Some of the main flaws of democracy are:
1) It is very expensive to conduct a vote and so is used infrequently.  While technology could be used to overcome this, consulting everybody or nobody would remain inefficient.
2) It takes no cognizance of individuals differing levels of knowledge and interest.
3) It tends to require large amounts of funding to get elected.  This is typically achieved by making promises to backers which determine policy once elected.
These methods of group decision making simply cannot support an aligned global effort to implement a strategy to improve the world.  As Einstein noted:

"The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them."

### General acceptance of poor standards of behavior

There is very little discussion on your planet at present on whether or not present standards of behavior are acceptable.  It seems questionable if the planet will ever achieve its potential while wealth is so concentrated and with some people having wealth in the billions while others are dying of starvation.  Some sort of dialogue on the acceptability of this behavior could be called for and a plan put in place to address the imbalances.  Discussions along the line of “Your yacht may be too large Mr. Abramovich” are simply not taking place.

## Apathy

The attitude that you have captured in the saying “I’m all right Jack” may also be part of the problem.  Many of you presently are all right at any point in time.  You must realize this is a temporary state of affairs and with your current level of healthcare, none of you will be all right for terribly long.  Given your current knowledge and methods, it is exceedingly unlikely that any of you will live for more than 120 years and you will certainly be affected to at least some extent by the debilitating effects of aging during the second half of any life that approaches this length.  So apathy and selfishness need to be addressed.  With co-operation and effort, many of you alive today could get to live for thousands of years.  Surely that is a prize worth striving for, particularly when you consider the amount of progress and development that is likely in the future.

## Poor and selfish decision making

There is lots of bad and selfish decision making taking place on your planet at present and a real problem with planning for the medium and long term.  You need to figure out ways to curb human nature that tends to look to continually acquire personal wealth.  We will go into this area in a bit more detail in an appendix looking at key areas of exploitation as we see things.  The US healthcare system is an astonishing example of the agency problem and truly predatory pricing where the patient is the victim of institutionalized fraud.  However, with global warming, the exploitation is more nuanced and it is more akin to a religion seeking control than an attempt to gouge money.  Nonetheless, the diversion of resources for a cause without a case is massive and must stop.  There are many environmental challenges to be addressed urgently and the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is not high on the list, yet, it has hijacked so many agendas recently. 

## Communication Problems

There are major issues with human communication that need to be faced.  So many times people mask and hide their true feelings and find themselves unable to express their true feelings and opinions for various reasons.  Political correctness, anti-isms, and promotion of fake news for dubious ends have contorted communication into all sorts of strange places in recent years.  There are also long-established challenges with communication with many topics that are important being taboo and even simple fact gathering in some areas is fraught with difficulties.  For example to aid understanding of behavior and mood it can be helpful to establish a women's point in her cycle.  However, there is simply no point in the conversation at which the question "Are you pre-menstrual?" is likely to work out well. You should ponder why that is and what that says about human communication.

## Conclusion

The problem seems to be tied up in all of the above areas.  However, the inability to align countries, organizations and wealth to work towards common goals appears the key problem.

Intelligent species on other planets were very much more open about the fact that they saw death as a problem.  While they recognized that to some extent at the individual level the problem can be exaggerated.  The time before people are born generally causes them very little distress and the time after death is doubtless equally so.  The pain of loss rests with the living,  However creatures on other planets were still very clear that they didn’t want to die because they enjoyed living and they were all prepared to work together to fulfill that goal as soon as possible.  When the highway robber of past years pointed his gun at the traveler with the question – “Your money or your life?” it seems the normal response was to hand over the money.  However, when it comes to the slow decay that the aging process causes then it seems your species prefers money to life.  This is quite puzzling.

While we’re not sure we’ll ever understand why you’ve made this choice we do believe that a more organized approach to decision making will help both you and us to understand each other better.  This solution has worked very well elsewhere and there is no obvious reason why it can’t work here.  We’ve outlined the approach in the next chapter and continued at a little more length in the appendix.
