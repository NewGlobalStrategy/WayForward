<h1>Conclusion</h1><p>There is much work to do and maximizing the talents you have to create the right incentives and move cooperation to a whole new level is the key to getting the planet that you may feel ought to be possible if other people just behaved better.  Past generations aimed to be dead rich, future generations will aim to be neither.  You are at a key turning point.</p><p>Hard determinism helps you realize that people will always do what they think suits them best and this isn’t going to change.  Instead we must change what people think.  Change will happen exactly the way it was always going to happen – because you are all amazing creatures living in a deterministic universe.</p><p>Remember that your priorities are in order: 1	Establish a global decision-making structure, that will then evolve as a result of the decisions made on it 2	Use this system to establish the agreed global strategy for the planet as a whole 3	Break down that strategy into specific local actions that are required and prioritize them 4	Communicate the strategy widely and consider providing benefits now for good behavior rather than deluding people that they may get these in an after-life</p><p>The networked decision-making system can give very clear feedback to people on whether or not others think they are well behaved and helpful.  You can train most people to behave well most of the time and those that are can be rewarded with better healthcare rights.  This can provide some much-needed focus and accelerate continuous improvement.</p><p>It should be straightforward to integrate this with some of your existing social networking software.  By the standards of the modern universe this planet is a complete mess and it will take you many years of hard work to reach a point that would be considered acceptable.</p><p>Remember the steps you already follow in your leading companies and apply them on a bigger scale, reward good behavior and report bad and remember the perpetrator has no choice about their actions so they cannot be blamed.  In due course, you can work to phase out money as it’s very wasteful once people know how to behave.  You should find it really good fun to get everyone involved and fix the planet and remember that’s only the beginning – you’ve got a whole universe to help explore after that.</p><p>Nothing proposed here should require anyone to break any existing laws to progress.  Your laws represent the documented agreement on acceptable behavior and while there are massive opportunities and challenges in harmonizing laws the decision-making system should help make it clear which laws are most in need of change and provide that mandate for change.  Admittedly many have been formed from money and lobbying to 'protect' special interests and established companies and this must now change.  Provided your leaders co-operate it shouldn’t be necessary to over-rule or violently overthrow them and you should be able to design a structure of incentives that makes it in their long term interest to co-operate.</p><p>There are likely to be straggler nations that have specific challenges, however on other planets, we have found they tend to want to join in the process of global change rather than be isolated from it – so this is generally not as big a problem as it appears once the majority get going.</p><p>For the theists on your planet, a networked decision-making system that provides some consensual judgment can be an added incentive to behave well.  Perhaps even viewed as shaping a model God that does exist as this is something far bigger and more powerful than any individual person.  While religious leaders will doubtless struggle with this, they should have little doubt that God would be very impressed that you have reached this stage of development on your planet and are starting to reach the point where man made god in his own image.  What bigger compliment could there be?  Until biogerontology has progressed significantly this will be a rather poor substitute for a real God.  However, you are making some real progress in reversing the aging process in mice and you know that mice have significant biological similarities with humans.  So the elusive elixir of life may be closer than you realize.</p><p>For the atheists, focussing on living longer and getting people better aligned on progress ought to be exciting and rational.  My arrival proves both right and wrong at the same time.  Correct that there is no supernatural god, but wrong in that they are now part of a universe with a powerful virtual master.  The influence of the universal council should remain minimal as long as reforms progress in line with the global strategy you establish.</p><p>For the planet, the zeitgeist moves on and a new epoch begins.</p>
