<h1>Avenues of progress</h1><p>Conventional books conclude at the end - but this text is not conventional.  It is a living document and following the conclusion this chapter aims to review promising initiatives for moving the world forward.  Overcoming inertia is difficult and these initiatives have done that and made progress.  A TED talk highlighted that the success of humans over other animals was largely due to their ability to cooperate (15) but failure to progress further seems in large part because that cooperation is not nearly as deep and far reaching as it theoretically could be.</p><p>There are several initiatives that we are aware of and many more to be discovered.  We would hope this could continue and merge with some of the ideas outlined earlier.  However, none has attained critical mass to unsheath the level of progress the planet needs for the long term survival of the majority of its current inhabitants.  This section will expand as progress continues.</p><p>For now, we will review the following groups:</p><p>1. The Zeitgeist Movement</p><p>2. The Social Progress Index</p><p>3. Global Citizen</p><p>4. Jubilee Debt</p><p>5. Democracy OS</p><p>6. Charles Hugh Smith</p><p>7. The Moneyless Society</p><p>8. Calico (Alphabet)</p><p>9. Bitcoin</p><p>10. Ethereum</p><p>11. We agree</p><p>12. Weave - the social fabric project</p><p>13. Electroverse</p><h2>The Zeitgeist Movement (<a href="https://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com">https://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com</a>/)</h2><p>The Zeitgeist Movement is entirely correct on the need to move to a natural law resource-based world.  The challenge is to provide a compelling plan for how to get there.  Unfortunately, they are largely ignored by the mainstream media perhaps because the mainstream media is controlled by the elite and their role is to maintain suppression and avoid unrest.  There are many chapters globally and they are working on awareness but we think there need to be more proactive approaches as the prize is so large and the risks of attempting to perpetuate the current structures are significant.  Indeed the rise in basically anti-immigration, nationalistic and protectionist politics throughout Europe suggests that momentum is if anything currently shifting in the opposite direction at the same time as many people from both the Middle East and Africa are very understandably 'voting' with their feet and attempting to move to Europe where the level of social progress is significantly higher.  We think an agreed democratic on-line decision-making platform is a key enabler for progress towards a new world.</p><h2>Social Progress Index (www.socialprogressimperative.org/data/spi)</h2><p>We previously mentioned the social progress indicator as providing a reasonable overview of the current state of the planet.  This doesn't really make for pretty reading with such wide variations between countries, albeit overall progress is being made on many fronts, just not at anything like the rate that would be possible with better alignment and teamwork.  The most recent 2021 survey has recently been published and in general, showed slow progress in many areas.</p><h2>Global Citizen (<a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en">https://www.globalcitizen.org/en</a>/)</h2><p>The global citizen movement has adopted the social progress index and plans to produce a people's report card on the performance of each country against the social progress index criteria annually.  (<a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/campaign/peoples-report-card">https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/campaign/peoples-report-card</a>/)  This seems a very promising initiative to cover the assessment of leaders' compliance with the global strategy.  We just need to discuss if some new incentives are appropriate to help leaders to achieve these goals.  Global citizen has recently launched a new initiative to build a movement of 100M action-taking citizens to help achieve their vision of ending extreme poverty by 2030.  This is an encouraging initiative.</p><h2>Jubilee Debt Campaign (<a href="http://jubileedebt.org.uk">http://jubileedebt.org.uk</a>)</h2><p>This is an organization campaigning to cancel the debts of the poorest countries.  Our view is that we should be seeking to cancel all debts and money as the so-called debt supercycle seems to be a key part of the problem and it is retarding progress in many areas.  Achieving this in something resembling a fair and reasonable way is a key challenge for the future and we don't think it is acceptable to do this overnight.  Your current methods of debt management are simply not up to the job as you have embarrassingly demonstrated in the on-going Greek tragedy.  We see an online platform for debt management and reduction as the only method to avoid a near infinitude of lawyers becoming involved if you attempted cancellation and re-negotiation using your current methods.</p><h2>DemocracyOS (<a href="http://democracyos.org">http://democracyos.org</a>)</h2><p>Democracy OS is a very encouraging initiative to provide a platform for influencing politicians and they have had some notable successes within Argentina.  They are planning a new platform soon and hopefully, they can get an increased global profile in the not too distant future and may then be able to drive real change across the world.  To date again they seem to be getting rather ignored by the political elite as an inconvenience that they will seek to defer for as long as possible rather than something to be embraced and encouraged.</p><p>It appears the new platform will provide strong authentication/encryption and will include a robust solution for voting using the bitcoin platform.  It is due for initial release during 2016 and will be an open-source solution.  We are looking to understand how well it can fit in with our vision of a global decision-making system and are very hopeful as this solution at least seems to recognize some of the opportunities such solutions may bring.  The new website with details appears to be at <a href="http://democracy.earth">http://democracy.earth</a>.  There is now a good paper explaining what they are trying to achieve at <a href="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper">https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper</a> and we are supportive of this work but concerned that the complexity may be too high for quick adoption.</p><h2>Charles Hugh Smith CLIME (<a href="http://www.oftwominds.com">http://www.oftwominds.com</a>)</h2><p>The blogger Charles Hugh Smith has outlined a system for community labor integrated money economy (CLIME) which seeks to address some issues with life at present.  There would be a core framework and a central theme is the adoption of digitally issued money and consequent weakening of the privilege of banks with access to centrally issued money.  Activities would be organized locally by groups and individuals and they would trade using the digital money largents.  While there are many attractive features of this system, it is not as ambitious as the Zeitgeist movement as competition remains core to the solution.  Our overall thinking is that competition would be correctly classified as part of the problem, not the solution.  However, competition is deeply engrained within the human psyche and it may be that initiatives such as CLIME are necessary steps along the road of progress.  It seems highly likely that it will be local community initiatives that turn out to be globally scaleable rather than change imposed by existing leaders which will drive the key moves to a better future.</p><p>This is a very interesting read and highly recommended reading as the system proposed could be a significant step forward if it could be implemented.  However, this will not be straightforward and we have two main issues with the proposal:</p><ul><li>It seems to go too far to be easy to get off the ground</li><li>It isn't radical enough to fully address the issues we face.  Ultimately Inappropriate competition is part of the problem and the solution seems to be to get a whole society working together - however clearly this is easier said than done.  The zeitgeist movement appears to be correct that we have to aim for that ideal.</li></ul><p>I think the introduction of a system like this needs some central structure and better group decision making schemes than are currently established and this view in part explains the current focus on group decision making structures.  These appear little changed by the Internet age and remain a key driver of inequality, disengagement, and disillusionment.  It also seems worthwhile to explore if crowdsourcing could create a new wrapper of accountability over global leaders and alignment with global strategy.  Even the widespread discussion of this possibility could create a significant positive change in the behavior of those with power and wealth.</p><h2>Wael Ghonim</h2><p>Wael Ghonim is suggesting some improvements and changes to social media and our interactions on it in his Ted Talk:  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_let_s_design_social_media_that_drives_real_change?language=en">https://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_let_s_design_social_media_that_drives_real_change?language=en</a></p><p>There are  5 main points which he identifies that need to be addressed.  These are:</p><p>1.	There is currently no process to deal with rumors 2.	We tend to create echo chambers and only engage and communicate with like-minded people 3.     Online discussions tend to descend into angry mobs 4.     We struggle to change our opinions once formed even in the light of new facts 5.     Current media experiences favor broadcasting over engagement</p><p>We have created an event to discuss, verify and act on these ideas at:</p><p><a href="http://www.netdecisionmaking.com">http://www.netdecisionmaking.com</a></p><h2>Moneyless Society (<a href="http://www.moneylesssociety.com/home">http://www.moneylesssociety.com/home</a>/)</h2><p>The moneyless society recognizes the need to get beyond money as a key step on the human journey of progress.  It has a good deal in common with the Zeitgeist Movement above.  It does, however, provides some additional links to good sources of information.   The actual transition plan is not yet clear as this is not a straightforward change for humans to make.</p><h2>Calico(Alphabet)  (www.calicolabs.com)</h2><p>It is encouraging that Google has committed some of its significant resources to the battle against aging.  At the same time, we do feel Google could do more - there are many enormously wealthy individuals associated with this company and there is still a very pervasive mind block among the wealthy that fights to maintain the status quo.  We are convinced that humanity is capable of much better but appreciate the transformation may need better tools to organize and share the vision and way forward than we currently have.  Significant dilution of hierarchy and empowerment seem to be necessary steps along the way.</p><h2>Bitcoin</h2><p>While Bitcoin itself is largely famed for supporting shady deals and limited accountability the underlying technology of the blockchain is a genuine innovation.  This has created a mechanism to create trust between people and build consensus around a globally accepted ledger.  It should be possible to extend this to many other problems fairly quickly.</p><h2>Ethereum</h2><p>Ethereum is another blockchain-based solution that appears to be gaining traction from various global players.  It may hopefully have more diverse and disruptive solutions than bitcoin which may help with progress.  We aim to review this in more detail soon.</p><h2>We Agree (www.weagree.life)</h2><p>This initiative seems to have some links to the Zeigeist movement however it is a separate site and proposal which again outlines where we should be aiming to get to.  However once again the details on how we do it are scarce.  We still think scalable decision-making systems and some sort of record of what people are up to are necessary pre-requisites to a global democracy with the mandate to change the planet in a co-ordinated manner.</p><h2>Weave (www.aspeninstitute.org)</h2><p>Weave is a project to heal the social fabric of the USA and we are increasingly convinced that the lack of social cohesion and common purpose is the most significant barrier to progress.  Individual wealth generation appears heavily dependent on the exploitation of the vulnerable and the weak and this seriously depresses the overall speed of progress.  Building alignment around common global goals and properly rewarding in some manner those that put the effort in to strive towards them seems to be a very critical challenge.  Better relationships and caring engagement with others do seem to get to the fundamentals of how we might start to do this.  Undoubtedly there is a long road ahead as politics in many countries seem to be fostering division and immigration also seems to be predominantly portrayed as a problem when it should present a massive opportunity to share and align at a global level.</p><h2>Electroverse (Electroverse.net)</h2><p>It may seem odd to put a site focusing on the upcoming solar minimum and impact on the magnetosphere in this list.  We feel actual data tracking of things like Greenland Snow Mass Balance, Northern Hemisphere snow mass and the general global cooling that is currently underway as we enter a solar minimum is rather crucial to provide some semblance of balance against the global warming hysteria that currently blights the planet.  We still have a lot more to learn about climate and overall global cooling seems to be a bigger threat to life than warming. It seems reasonable to believe that phases of both will be in this planet's future, just as they were part of the past and until we understand all the factors in play we will need to adapt or perish.  Adapting seems perfectly practical with increased levels of cooperation and creativity and resultant efficiency.</p>
