# Regulators Ban Water
Once upon a time, there was a very wealthy man. His fortune was amassed dominating unregulated markets.  Seeking a novel challenge, he turned his attention to the regulated market for fire suppression and control.

Fire, an age-old force, had long eluded complete understanding. Recent advances in comprehension had birthed new methods of prevention and suppression. It was universally acknowledged that fire posed a grave danger, leading to stringent testing and regulatory approval processes. The aspiration to control fire had become a paramount goal for humanity.

The affluent man founded a new organization dedicated to identifying superior fire control and prevention measures and committed his vast resources to the fire prevention industry. To save public funds, the regulators became increasingly funded by the industry they were regulating and shared in the profits of newly approved methods. The ethics of this arrangement were not questioned and remain largely undiscussed to this day. Regulatory capture was complete.

Despite dire warnings from the wealthy and influential man about potential new and catastrophic fire types, years passed without any significant emergence. Research into risky fire control methods was discreetly conducted abroad, where oversight was lax, and penalties more lenient.  Research was often funded by the regulators, and they paid people in foreign lands to test new types of matches and accelerants.  Some of these people started to get burned with a new type of fire and while this was a concern the media controlled the message and made clear that this was not caused by the experiments.  It was merely coincidence that the fires started where the research was taking place.

The new fire variant spread globally, necessitating a new fire suppressant. The existing regulatory and patent framework discouraged the use of established fire control methods against new fires as costs of approval were high and profits low.  In numerous countries, regulations forbade the use of water against this unprecedented threat, influenced by a media largely funded by the fire suppression industry.

Existing safe and effective methods would make new, risky, and lucrative approaches far more challenging to approve. There were no suitable studies of the effectiveness of water against this type of fire and anecdotal evidence supporting water’s early-stage effectiveness was in-admissible.  The regulators, strict when it suited them, contributed to the tragic consequences of the new fire types.  Citizens in countries that defied the ban on water, often already relying on it for other fires, suffered far less.

The wealthy man’s fortune grew, the fire companies and the regulators were enriched and became more controlling and influential.  They all lived, except for those that died, unhappily ever after.
